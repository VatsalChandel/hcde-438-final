# Vatsal Chandel's HCDE 438 Final
This is my final project for HCDE 438. It is a REACT app called CoffeNote that allows users to track all previous and future coffee shops that they want to go to. It also allows you to see where those shops are on a map and how much of the city you have explored. 

## Important Things To Note
This app uses firebase, all of the config information is hidden. It also uses the Google Maps API, the key for that is hidden and will probably stop working in 90 days. 

On top of that, to run it locally, you will need to request a demo servo from [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo). Once the demo is requested, you are able to run this locally.
